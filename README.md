Tic Tac Toe Homework

This is the completed version of my first homework project. A simple game of tic tac toe, rendered
100% in the browser. 

I have three seperate files for HTML, CSS, and JS.

The game table is set up using a simbple table format.

All CSS is done manually, and efforts were made to make the application look nice in various revolutions.
However, the responsiveness is very limited.

To make things easier, I created two arrays in JavaScript. One for each player character. I also made multiple functions,
ranging from player switching, to setting the timer (Using setInterval()).

Using jQuery, I inserted HTML onto the page using .html(). This was done by having a CSS style for the classes of the
player characters.
